Recently, we were glad to attend a two-day Workshop, hosted at NCSR DEMOKRITOS
in Athens, Greece. The workshop implemented a training approach for
awareness-raising and empowerment of existing German-Greek research projects.

Keynotes on knowledge transfer and exercises (practical application of knowledge)
provided participants the opportunity to gain practical experience
 and hone their skills with regard to the transfer of knowledge

and technology. Addressing individual motives, incentives and possible forms of commercialisation
early in the process helps formulating a shared objective with regard to the commercialization of pro-
ject outcomes, which is the aim of the first day of the training measure. On the second Workshop day,
the formation of ideas plays a particular role in developing a shared objective for the commercialisa-
tion of R&D results. Participants will form groups to identify practical applications of their R&D results
(technological applications) in a first step and define in a second step unmet customer needs and
work on a better understanding of these needs (market development).
