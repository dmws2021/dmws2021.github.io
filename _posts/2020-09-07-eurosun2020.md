As everyone affected by the latest measures for the pandemic, the EuroSun
13th International Conference on Solar Energy for Buildings and Industry
was not hosted in Athens, Greece as planned, but on a specifically
designed web platform. Nevertheless, we did not miss the opportunity to
showcase our work.
