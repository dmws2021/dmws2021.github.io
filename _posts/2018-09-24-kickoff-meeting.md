We were really excited to attend SCoSCo's kickoff meeting in Jülich.
We were able to organize our work plan effectively, after having discussed a lot interesting ideas on the implementation of our project.
The present participants introduced themselves with relevant information about their endeavours and expertise.

Prof. Alexopoulos introduces the SIJ and its specific fields of work to the participants.
Mr. Konstantinidis introduces the company Calpak. Calpak, which has a long experience in producing
low-temperature solar collectors. The portfolio includes a range of different collector types (FPC,
VTC), thermosiphonic systems, and water tanks. The company has an established distribution system
and is holding several Solar Keymark certifications.
Nowadays the company is building a new production site in Corinth including a warehouse, offices
and an exhibition room. In order to cool the exhibition room the collector type, under development
within ScoSco, might be used in combination with a double-effect absorption chiller.
The company Heliokon was introduced by Mr. Yousefpour.

The objectives and the timetable of the project were presented.
By mutual agreement, it was decided to postpone the timetable by 3 months, due to a delayed start
date in each country:

Next project meeting should take place at UPAT in April/May 2019.
