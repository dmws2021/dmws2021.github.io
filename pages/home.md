**S**olar **Co**llectors with **S**tatic **Co**ncentrators  
for applications at intermediate to medium temperatures

The SCoSCo studies static concentrators combined with suitable tracked
absorbers in order to adapt efficient solar thermal collector operation in
intermediate temperatures with effective extension to medium temperatures,
suitable also for building integration. These innovative solar systems are
based on the effective use of the non-uniform distribution of the converged
solar radiation on the focal plane of static concentrators. Two solar collector
configurations with low concentration CPC static reflector are proposed. The
first collector uses a tracking absorber that receives the concentrated solar
rays and a second one, fully static, has an array of separate absorbers on the
focal plane, selecting for the fluid flow the receivers with the higher
concentration. The receivers in both systems consist of absorbers in evacuated
tubes; a suitable secondary absorber can be applied, operating in lower
temperatures by using the diffuse radiation.

The above collectors will be compared with two lower cost static solar thermal
systems, an efficient flat plate collector and an evacuated tube collector,
combined with flat reflectors in front of them as booster reflectors,
to increase operating temperature and thermal output. These low concentration
collectors aim to efficient solar thermal applications in the range of
100°C to 250°C, for solar thermal cooling, process heat in industry,
desalination, water treatment, etc.

The SCoSCo project partners are from the German side the
Solar-Institut Jülich (SIJ),  Heliokon GmbH and Hilger GmbH.
From the Hellenic side, it is the University of Patras (UPAT) and Calpak S.A..
The main responsibility of the German part is the design, the determination of
the used materials and the operation requirements of the new concentrating
solar systems. The Hellenic part, being the main supporter of the project
concept, will work mainly in leading the construction and testing of the
collectors in outdoors conditions.
